# Mopedometer

A Raspberry Pi based data display & logger. Relies heavily on Adafruit products & libraries. Primarily designed to gather temperature data on Moped engines.

## Current status

Exhaust Gas Temp. sensor, display & logging is working.

Working on improving program interactivity and data logging organization.

Still heavily wired :(

## Goal

User friendly dash mounted Mopedometer with a minimum of wires (hint: wifi connectivity & database server)
